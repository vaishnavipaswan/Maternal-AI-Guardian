# Streamlit App for Maternal AI Guardian

This folder contains the Streamlit applications for the **Maternal-AI-Guardian** project. These apps provide interactive web interfaces to support maternal health monitoring, AI-driven predictions, and user engagement.

## Folder Purpose

The `streamlit` directory holds all Streamlit scripts, components, and resources required to launch the user-facing dashboards and tools. These applications are designed to be user-friendly, enabling easy access to the project's AI models and data visualizations.

## Typical Contents

- `*.py`: Streamlit Python application scripts.
- `assets/`: (If present) Static resources such as images, CSS, or other media for the apps.
- `requirements.txt`: (If present) Python dependencies specifically needed for the Streamlit apps.

## Getting Started

1. **Install Dependencies**

   Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed. Install the required packages (if a requirements file is present):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run a Streamlit App**

   Launch the main app (replace `app.py` with the actual entry-point script):

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

3. **Access the App**

   Open your browser and go to the URL shown in the terminal (typically `http://localhost:8501`).

## Example Features

- Maternal health data visualization
- AI-powered risk prediction tools
- User-friendly data input forms
- Interactive dashboards

## Contribution

To add a new Streamlit app, create a new `.py` file in this folder and ensure it follows the projectâ€™s coding and UI guidelines. Update this README if you add major features or new applications.
